    <p>FastQC is a quality control application that allows  users to perform some quality control checks on the raw sequence data (in FASTQ format) generated by high throughput sequencing pipelines such as Illumina, ABI SOLiD platforms. It provides a comprehensive report on the composition and quality of reads in html format that can be viewed and downloaded.</p>

    <p>The HTML report shows a summary of the modules that were run by FastQC, and provides a quick assessment of the quality of the results. The result legends differentiate among normal (green tick), slighly abnormal (orange exclamation), and very unusual (red cross) reads.</p>

    <p>Basic Statistics: This app generates the simple composition statistics such as file name, file type, encoding, total sequences, filtered sequences, sequence length for the read object analyzed.</p>

    <p>Per Base Sequence Quality: It provides an overview of the range of quality values across all bases at each position in the FastQ file.</p>

    <p>Per Sequence Quality Scores: It allows users to see if a subset of the sequences have universally low quality values.</p>

    <p>Per Base Sequence Content: It generates the plots out the proportion of each base position in a file for which each of the four normal DNA bases has been called.</p>

    <p>Per Sequence GC content: It provides the GC content across the whole length of each sequence in a file and compares it to a modelled normal distribution of GC content.</p>

    <p>Per Base N Content: It plots out the percentage of base calls at each position for which an N was called.</p>

    <p>Sequence Length Distribution: It generates a graph showing the distribution of fragment sizes in the file which was analysed. </p>

    <p>Sequence Duplication Levels: It counts the degree of duplication for every sequence in a library and creates a plot showing the relative number of sequences with different degrees of duplication.</p>

    <p>Overrepresented Sequences: It lists all of the sequence which make up more than 0.1% of the total. To conserve memory only sequences which appear in the first 100,000 sequences are tracked to the end of the file. It is therefore possible that a sequence which is overrepresented but doesn't appear at the start of the file for some reason could be missed by this module.</p>

    <p>Adapter Content: It provides the information on the significant amount of adapter in order to be able to assess whether you need to trim adapter or not by doing a specific search for a set of separately defined Kmers. It will provide a view of the total proportion of the library which contain these Kmers.</p>

    <p>Kmer Content: It will measure the number of each 7-mer at each position in the library and then uses a binomial test to look for significant deviations from an even coverage at all positions.</p>
